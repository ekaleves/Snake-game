# Snake-game
The player controls a snake that moves nonstop, picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The player uses the arrow keys from the keyboard to move the snake.
